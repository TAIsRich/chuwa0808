## HW12

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
annotaitons.md

### 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Spingboot?
```
Simply put, the Spring framework provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
It's packed with some nice features like Dependency Injection, and out of the box modules like:
•	Spring JDBC
•	Spring MVC
•	Spring Security
•	Spring AOP
•	Spring ORM
•	Spring Test
These modules can drastically reduce the development time of an application.
For example, in the early days of Java web development, we needed to write a lot of boilerplate code to insert a record into a data source. By using the JDBCTemplate of the Spring JDBC module, we can reduce it to a few lines of code with only a few configurations.

Spring Boot is basically an extension of the Spring framework, which eliminates the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application.
It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform, which paves the way for a faster and more efficient development ecosystem.
Here are just a few of the features in Spring Boot:
•	Opinionated ‘starter' dependencies to simplify the build and application configuration
•	Embedded server to avoid complexity in application deployment
•	Metrics, Health check, and externalized configuration
•	Automatic config for Spring functionality – whenever possible
Advantages of a Spring Boot application
•	Fast and easy development of Spring-based applications;
•	No need for the deployment of war files;
•	The ability to create standalone applications;
•	Helping to directly embed Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow into an application;
•	No need for XML configuration;
•	Reduced amounts of source code;
```

### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
```
DI: Dependency injection is the process by which Spring looks up the beans that
are needed for a particular bean to function and injects them as a
dependency. Spring can perform dependency injection by using constructor
or by using a setter method or by field injection.

IOC(inversion of control): The framework takes the responsibility for finding out the
dependencies of a component, ensuring their availability and injecting them
in the component. This process is called Inversion of Control
```

### 4. What is @CompnonentScan?
```
Define where the spring need to scan the bean definations and generate the beans 
```

### 5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
```
With Spring, we use the @ComponentScan annotation along with the @Configuration annotation to specify the packages that we want to be scanned. @ComponentScan without arguments tells Spring to scan the current package and all of its sub-packages.

```

### 6. What is @SpringbootApplication?
```
The @SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to using @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan with their default attributes. Spring Boot enables the developer to use a single annotation instead of using multiple. But, as we know, Spring provided loosely coupled features that we can use for each annotation as per our project needs.
```

### 7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
```
Three ways in the following.
Class level: @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller
Method level: @Bean(used with @Configuration) together
XML: <bean id=”XXX” class=”com.xxx.xxx”></bean>
```

### 8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
```
@Component is the class name with first character lowercase
@Bean is the method name with first character lowvercase
```

### 9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
```
•	@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
•	@Service annotates classes at the service layer.
•	@Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer, which will act as a database repository.
The major difference between these stereotypes is that they are used for different classifications. 

```

### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
```
@Autowired
@Resource
@Inject
```

### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
```
Constructor Injection
Setter Injection
Field Injection

Constructor Injection is better,  Constructor injection helps in creating immutable objects because a constructor's signature is the only possible way to create objects. Once we create a bean, we cannot alter its dependencies anymore

```

### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
```
* 1. 如果只有一个impl,则默认用这个impl
* 2. 如果有多个impl, 则查看是否有@Qualifier
* 3. 如果有多个impl, 且无@Qualifier, 则查看是否有@Primary (因为这个是type level的)
* 4. 如果有多个impl, 且无@Qualifier, 且無@Primary, 按变量名(By Name)确定用哪一个
* 5. 如果依然不能确定用哪一个，则报错(NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException)

The @Primary annotation is used for making a component the default choice when multiple beans of the same type are found.

If no primary, choose by name
```

### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
```
The basic version of the Spring IoC container is bean factory. It is the legacy
IoC container and provides basic management for beans and wiring of
dependencies. In Spring, bean factory still exists to provide backward
compatibility.

Application context adds more features to the bean factory that are typically
needed by an enterprise application. It is the most important part of the
Spring framework. All the core logic of Spring happens here. It includes
basic management of beans and wiring of dependencies as provided by the
bean factory. Additional features in application context include Spring AOP
features, internationalization, web application context, etc.
```

### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
```
Basic:
Singleton
prototype
Web:
Request
Session

SR.NO. SCOPE & DESCRIPTION
1 singleton	This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC
container (default).
2 prototype	This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object
instances.
3 request	This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the
context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
4 session	This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the
context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
5 global-session	This scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only
valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

```

### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml,
and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old,
I am not sure if I need to explain it in class)
```
•	<beans .....>
•	    <import resource="common/Spring-Common.xml"/>
•	    <import resource="connection/Spring-Connection.xml"/>
•	    <import resource="module/Spring-Module.xml"/>
•	  	<bean id="user" class="cn.tedu.spring.User">
•	        <property name="name" value="Mike"/>
•	        <property name="from" value="Beijing"/>
•	        <property name="age" value="26"/>
•	        <property name="regTime" ref="now"/>
•	    </bean>
•	</beans>

```
