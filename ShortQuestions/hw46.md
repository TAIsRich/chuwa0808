3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
 * Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming technique that supports the separation of cross-cutting concerns in order to increase modularity.

 * AOP is typically used to implement cross-cutting concerns, which implies that it defines functionality that is required in multiple places across an application in one place. You can add new functionality before or after a method is executed like transaction management, logging or security which cut across multiple types and objects (often termed crosscutting concerns).

4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
 * Advantages of Spring AOP
   * It is easy to configure.
   * Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java, so separate compilation unit or separate class loader are not required.
   * It utilizes Spring's IOC container for dependency injection.
   * Can create aspects using @Aspect annotation based or using XML based.
   * It integrates cross-cutting concerns into the classes.

 * Disadvantages of Spring AOP
   * Debugging the AOP framework-based application code is a little challenge.
   * Only methods with a public visibility will be recommended, not those with a private, protected, or default visibility.
   * Aspects cannot be advised by other aspects. This is because once a class is marked as an aspect (using XML or annotation), Spring prevents it from being auto-proxied.

5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
 * An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management. Aspects can be a normal class configured through Spring XML configuration or we can use Spring AspectJ integration to define a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.

6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
 * Pointcut is a set of one or more JoinPoint where an advice should be executed. Pointcuts allow you to specify where you want your advice to be applied. Often you specify these pointcuts using explicit class and method names or through regular expressions that define matching class and method name patterns.

7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
 * Join Point: A join point is a specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values, etc. In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method.

8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
 * Advice: Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application. 

 * Based on the execution strategy of advice, they are of the following types.
   * **@Before:** These advices runs before the execution of join point methods. We can use @Before annotation to mark an advice type as Before advice.

   * **@After:** An advice that gets executed after the join point method finishes executing, whether normally or by throwing an exception. We can create after advice using @After annotation.

   * **@After Returning:** Sometimes we want advice methods to execute only if the join point method executes normally. We can use @AfterReturning annotation to mark a method as after returning advice.

   * **@After Throwing:** This advice gets executed only when join point method throws exception, we can use it to rollback the transaction declaratively. We use @AfterThrowing annotation for this type of advice.

   * **@Around:** This is the most important and powerful advice. This advice surrounds the join point method and we can also choose whether to execute the join point method or not. We can write advice code that gets executed before and after the execution of the join point method. It is the responsibility of around advice to invoke the join point method and return values if the method is returning something. We use @Around annotation to create around advice methods.

9. What is Spring AOP Proxy?
 * AOP proxy is an object that is formed when advice is applied to a target object. The JDK dynamic proxy is used by Spring AOP to build proxy classes with target classes and advice invocations.

11. When to use Spring Batch?
  * Spring Batch can be used in both simple use cases (such as reading a file into a database or running a stored procedure) as well as complex, high volume use cases (such as moving high volumes of data between databases, transforming it, and so on). High-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.

  * Consider an environment where users have to do a lot of batch processing. This will be quite different from a typical web application which has to work 24/7. But in classic environments it's not unusual to do the heavy lifting for example during the night when there are no regular users using your system. Batch processing includes typical tasks like reading and writing to files, transforming data, reading from or writing to databases, create reports, import and export data and things like that. Often these steps have to be chained together or you have to create more complex workflows where you have to define which job steps can be run in parallel or have to be run sequentially etc. That's where a framework like Spring Batch can be very handy. Spring Boot Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It also provides more advanced technical services and features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs though optimization and partitioning techniques.Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.

12. How Spring Batch works?
 * Spring Batch follows the traditional batch architecture where a job repository does the work of scheduling and interacting with the job. A job can have more than one step. And every step typically follows the sequence of reading data, processing it and writing it.

13. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
 * You can execute Spring Batch Jobs periodically on a fixed schedule using some cron expressions that are passed to Spring TaskScheduler. Cron expressions in scheduling are used to represent the details of the schedule. Execute the above Spring Batch Jobs using Batch Spring Job Scheduler.

 * You can configure Spring Batch Jobs in two different ways:
   1. Using the @EnableScheduling annotation.
   2. Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. Then add the job execution logic inside this method.
