### 2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
```
Spring is an open-source lightweight framework that allows developers to build simple, reliable, and scalable enterprise applications.
The most important feature of the Spring Framework is dependency injection.

Spring Boot is built on top of the conventional spring framework. So, it provides all the features of spring and is yet easier to use than spring. 
Spring Boot is a microservice-based framework and making a production-ready application in very less time. 
The most important feature of the Spring Boot is Autoconfiguration.
```

### 3. What is IOC and What is DI?
```
Inversion of Control(IoC) is also known as Dependency injection (DI).

The Spring container uses Dependency Injection (DI) to manage the components that build up an application and these objects are called Spring Beans. 
Spring implements DI by either an XML configuration file or annotations.
```

### 4. What is `@CompnonentScan`?
```
@ComponentScan enables Spring to scan for things like configurations, controllers, services, and other components we define.

In particular, the @ComponentScan annotation is used with @Configuration annotation to specify the package for Spring to scan for components
```

### 5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
```
Spring can start scanning from the specified package, which we can define using basePackageClasses() or basePackages(). 

@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {"package1","com.chuwa.learning"},
  basePackageClasses = study.class)
```

### 6. What is `@SpringbootApplication`?
```
The @SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to using @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan with their default attributes
```

### 7. How many ways we can define a bean?
```
There are three different ways in which you can define a Spring bean:

Class level - annotating your class with the stereotype @Component @Service @Repository @Controller annotation 
Method level - writing a bean factory method annotated with the @Bean annotation in a @configuration class
XML - declaring a bean definition in an XML configuration file
```

### 8. What is default bean name for `@Component` and `@Bean`?
```
at @Component class level, use the class name and converts the first letter to lowercase
The default bean name is @Bean annotated method name
```

### 9. What is the difference between `@component` and `@service`, `@repository`?
```
They all allow Spring to detect beans automatically

@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
@Service annotates classes at the service layer.
@Repository annotates classes at the persistence layer, which will act as a database repository.
```

### 10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
```
@Autowired
@Resource
@Inject
```

### 11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
```
- Constructor Injection
@Autowired
public recommendType(Filter filter){
    this.filter = filter;
}

- Setter Injection
@Autowired
public void setFilter(Filter filter){
    this.filter = filter;
}

- Field Injection
@Autowired
private Filter filter;
```

### 12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
```
use @Primary to set one as the primary bean

@Autowired
private <interface> <class>

@Autowired
private <class> <objectName>

@Autowired
private <interface> <methodName>
```

### 13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
```
BeanFactory loads beans on-demand - Lazy Loading
ApplicationContext loads all beans at startup - Eager Loading
```

### 14. What is the Scope of a Bean?  and list the examples for each scope.
```
1 singleton - This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).
2 prototype - This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances.
3 request - This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
4 session - This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
5 global-session - This scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
```

### 15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial)
employee.xml
```
<beans>
   
  <bean id="employee" class="com.howtodoinjava.spring.beans.Employee"></bean>
   
</beans> 
```

beans.xml
```
<beans>
   
  <import resource="employee.xml"/>
   
  <bean id="operations" class="com.howtodoinjava.spring.beans.Operations"></bean>
   
</beans> 
```
