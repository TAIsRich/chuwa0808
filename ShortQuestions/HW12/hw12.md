1.What is the MVC pattern?

SpringMVC 是一个基于 Java 的实现了 MVC 设计模式的请求驱动类型的轻量级 Web 框架，通过把 Model，View，Controller 分离，将 web 层进行职责解耦，把复杂的 web 应用分成逻辑清晰的几部分，简化开发，减少出错，方便组内开发人员之间的配合。

Model，View，Controller 

Controller  业务逻辑

The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller. Controllers contain the 
business logic of the application. They also handle requests and perform marshalling/ 
unmarshalling. The function of the controller is to handle a user request. The incoming 
request may be handled in different ways like reading form data, processing it in some 
way, storing data in a database, or retrieving data from a web service etc. The controller 
places the data in the model which, simply put, is a container for the data. The controller 
returns the model (containing data) back to the front controller.

Model  数据库

Model is a container for data. It is used to transfer data from one part of the Spring MVC 
application to another.
Controller populates the model with data from a form or a database or a web service. As 
can be seen from the Spring MVC request flow diagram, the controller passes the model 
to the front controller which forwards it to the view resolver. The view template displays 
the data in the model.


View (template)  前端

Spring MVC supports a number of view templates. The most commonly used are JSP or 
JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library). Other view templates like Thymeleaf, Groovy, Velocity, 
and FreeMarker etc., can also be plugged in.
View template receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the 
data. If, say, the model contains a list of players, the view template can create a table to 
display that list. In most cases a view template is a JSP page that provides data to the user.




2.What is Front-Controller?

Front Controller is DispatcherServlet，DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and boilerplate tasks and focus on useful business logic:

Mapping an HTTP request to a certain processing method
Parsing of HTTP request data and headers into data transfer objects (DTOs)or 
domain objects
Model-view-controller interaction
Generation of responses from DTOs, domain objects, etc

将HTTP请求映射到某种处理方法
将 HTTP 请求数据和标头解析为数据传输对象 (DTO) 或
领域对象
模型-视图-控制器交互
从 DTO、域对象等生成响应

3.What is DispatcherServlet? Please describe how it works.

DispatcherServlet abstracts away the following tedious and boilerplate tasks and focus on useful business logic:

1.  Tomcat 收到Http Request，将request交给DispatcherServlet来处理

2.  DispatcherServlet 拿着该req去call Handler Mapper, 

3.  HanlerMapper将会找到对应的Controller以及对应的method，并返回给
dispactherServlet

4.  dispatcherServlet将call该Controller对应的method，此时会触发call service, 
repository and database. 

5.  然后结果(ModelAndView)再通过Controller返回。一般是返回view name, 一个字
符串，比如list-customers. 而数据是要set到Model 中。

6.  dispatcherServlet拿着view name去call view Resolver, 

7. View Resolver会帮助我们找到view template, 比如list-customers.jsp

8.  此时我们有了view template, 也有了数据model，则可以call View engine去帮助我
们把数据放到view templatel里，然后转换成纯粹的HTML

9.  该HTML就是前端显示的内容，最终返回给browser。

4.What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowledge)

JSP — Java Server Pages 是一种用于通过插入来开发网页的技术
通过制作特殊的 JSP 标签将 Java 代码写入 HTML 页面

JSP — Java Server Pages is a technology which is used to develop web pages by inserting 
Java code into the HTML pages by making special JSP tags

ModelAndView 是 Web MVC 框架中模型和视图的持有者。 这两个类别是不同的； ModelAndView 仅包含两者，以使控制器可以在单个返回值中返回模型和视图。 视图由 ViewResolver 对象解析； 模型是存储在地图中的数据

ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. These two classes are distinct; ModelAndView merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value. The view is resolved by a ViewResolver object; the model is data stored in a Map

5.Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就行。)

A Servlet is a class that handles requests, processes them and reply back with a response. For example, we can use a Servlet to collect input from a user through an HTML form, query records from a database, and create web pages dynamically.

ex : login logout register 

6.How many web servers do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)

There are mainly four types of web servers – Apache, IIS, Nginx and LiteSpeed.

7.  clone this repo, and run it in your local.

a. https://github.com/TAIsRich/springmvc5-demo
b. Notice that you need to configure the Tomcat by yourself. tutorial in 
the slides.
c.  find out the APIs in controller and call some APIs, In slides, I also list 
some API.
d.  remember to create a database for this project
e.  all details in the slides
