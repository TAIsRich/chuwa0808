### 3. What is the Aspect Oriented Programming?
```
aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
it breaks the code into different modules

Aspect - class to define all aop self methods
PointCut: expression to find all main application methods to insert AOP
Advice: before/after/around/afterThrowing - When to execute aop methods when the application pointcut is found
```

### 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
```
advantage
- It is non-invasive – not touching our code or business logic. 
- Its implemented in pure Java
- It uses Spring’s IOC for dependency injection
- Centralize or modularize the cross cutting concerns 
- Easy to configure

disadvantage:
- A little difficult to debug the AOP based application code.
- Only methods with public visibility will be advised
- Aspects cannot advise other Aspects - Not possible to have aspects to be the target of advice from other aspects.
```

### 5. What is Aspect in Spring AOP?
```
The class which implements the JEE application cross-cutting concerns(transaction, logger etc) is known as the aspect.
An aspect is a class that implements enterprise application concerns that cut across multiple classes, such as transaction management.
```

### 6. What is Pointcut in Spring AOP?
```
Pointcut is a set of one or more JoinPoint where an advice should be executed. 
Pointcuts allow you to specify where you want your advice to be applied
```

### 7. What is the Join point in Spring AOP?
```
An application has thousands of opportunities or points to apply Advice. These points are known as join points.
Spring AOP currently supports only method execution join points
```

### 8. What does it mean by Advice and its types in Spring AOP?
```
Advices are actions taken for a particular join point. 
In terms of programming, they are methods that get executed when a certain join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application.

@Before – Run before the method execution
@After – Run after the method returned a result
@AfterReturning – Run after the method returned a result, intercept the 
returned result as well.
@AfterThrowing – Run after the method throws an exception
@Around – Run around the method execution, combine all three advices above
```

### 9. What is Spring AOP Proxy?
```
Proxy is created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect contracts (advise method executions and so on).
```

### 11. When to use Spring Batch?
```
Spring Batch can be used in both simple use cases (such as reading a file into a database or running a stored procedure) 
as well as complex, high volume use cases (such as moving high volumes of data between databases, transforming it, and so on)

1. Define a job interface with abstract methods;
2. Define steps of how to dealing with the job
```

### 12. How Spring Batch works?
```
jobrepository does the work of scheduling and interacting with the job. 
A job can have more than one step. 
And every step typically follows the sequence of reading data, processing it and writing it.
```

### 13. How can we schedule a Spring Batch Job?
```
Method1: Using the @EnableScheduling annotation.

Method2: Creating a method annotated with @Scheduled and providing recurrence details with the job. 
Then add the job execution logic inside this method.
```
