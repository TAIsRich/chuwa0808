### 2. What is MVC pattern?
```
MVC stands for Model–view–controller. 
It is commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. 

- Controller
The front controller maps the incoming request to a controller. Controllers contain the business logic of the application. 
The function of the controller is to handle a user request.
The controller places the data in the model and returns the model (containing data) back to the front controller

- Model
Model is a container for data. It is used to transfer data from one part of the Spring MVC application to another.

- View
Spring MVC supports a number of view templates. The most commonly used are JSP or JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library)
View template receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the data.
```

### 3. What is Front-Controller?
```
Front Controller is DispatcherServlet
It is "a controller that handles all requests for a website"
```

### 4. What is DispatcherServlet? please decribe how it works.
```
When the web server receives the HTTP request, the DispatcherServlet will handle the request:
- DispatcherServlet will call the HandlerMapper, and the HandlerMapper will send back the corresponding controller and method;
- DispatcherServlet will then call this controller and method, which will call the service, repository, and database;
- controller will then return the MAV(ModelAndView) result. Specifically, it returns view name, which is usually string, and set date to the Model
- DispatcherServlet then will call the corresponding view Resolver based on the view name it gets
- View Resolver will help us find the view template
- With the view template and data model together, DispatcherServlet will call View Engine to put data in the view template and transfer it to HTML
- this HTML, which shows the frontend content, will be return to browser
```

### 5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have a basic knowlege)
```
JSP(Java Server Pages) is used as a view technology/template
It is a Web based technology helps us to create dynamic and platform independent web pages.

ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. 
ModelAndView merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value. 
The view is resolved by a ViewResolver object; the model is data stored in a Map .
```

### 6. Could you please google any other servlets
```
- Generic Servlet
- HTTP Servlet:
