3. design pattern - Singleton
	steps:  
			1. tatic volatile variable
			2. make constructor private
			3. static synchronized getInstance method
			4. make sure thread safe
	egs:
	 		Eager load:
	 		```
	 		public class Singleton {

	 			private static Singleton instance = new Singleton();

	 			private Singleton(){
	 			}

	 			public static Singleton getInstance(){
	 				return instance;
	 			}
	 		}
	 		```

	 		Lazy Load :
	 		```
	 		public class Singleton {
	 			private static volatile Singleton instance;

	 			private Singleton(){}

	 			public static Singleton getInstance() {
	 				if (instance == null) {
	 					synchronized (Singleton.class) {
	 						if (instance == null) {
	 							instance = new Singleton();
	 						}
	 					}
	 				}
	 				return instance
	 			
	 			]
	 		}
	 		```

4.  What is Runtime Exception? could you give me some examples?
	- Unchecked Exception, happens during runtime, could cause severe consequences. It's the parent class in all exceptions of java programming that are expected to crash or break down the program or application when they occur.
	- eg. NullPointerException
	 	  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	 	  NegativeArraySizeException
	 	  ArithmeticException
	 	  ClassCastException
	 	  DateTimeException
	 	  NoSuchElementException
	 	  ConcurrentModificationException
	 	  UnsupportedOperationException

5.  Could you give me one example of NullPointerException?
	```
	String data = null;
	System.out.println(data.length());
	```

6.  What is the Optional class?
	The Optional class in Java is a container that can hold, at max, one value and gracefully deals with null values. The class was introduced in the java.util package to remove the need for multiple null checks to protect against the dreaded NullPointerExceptions during run-time.


7. What is the @FunctionalInterface?
	It's an interface containing only one abstract methods. They can have only one functionality to exhibit. lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. 
	A functional interface can have any number of default methods. Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces. 

8.  what is lambda?
	It's a short of block code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
	Lambda expressions are like methods without a name implemented right in the body of a method. (parameter) -> expression
	eg. 
	```blockOfCode = (s) -> System.out.println(s);```

9.  What is Method Reference?
	It's a special type of lambda expressions. Used to create simple lambda expression by referencing existing methods. 
	eg. 
	```
	List<String> message = Arrays.asList("hello", "you", "puppies");
	messages.forEach(word -> StringUtils.capitalize(word));
	messages.forEach(StringUtils::capitalize);
	```
	eg.
	```
	List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 3, 50, 24, 40, 2, 9, 18);
	numbers.stream().sorted((a,b)-> a.compareTo(b));
	numbers.stream().sorted(Integer::compareTo);
	```
	eg.constructor
	```
	List<String> bikeBrands = Arrays.asList("Giant", "Scott", "Trek", "GT");
	public Bicycle(String brand) {
		this.brand = brand;
		this.size = 0;
	}

	bikeBrands.stream()
		.map(Bicycle::new)
		.toArray(Bicycle[]::new);
	```


10. What is Java 8 new features?
   - Default method and static method in interface
   - lambda & functional interface
   - Optional
   - Method Reference : ContainingClass::staticMethodName
   - Stream API


11. Lambda can use unchanged variable outside of lambda? what is the details?
	as long as the value inside the variable maintains unchanged, it can be used by lambda, including :
		- Final variable
		- Non-final variable but never changed
		- Object varible(not use new to reassign)
