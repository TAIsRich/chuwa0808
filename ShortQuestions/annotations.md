### 1. ist a code example under the annotations.
1. @Bean The @Bean annotations are used at the method level and indicate that a method produces a bean that is to be managed by Spring container. It is an alternative to the XML<bean> tag. 
2. @Service It is used at the class level. It shows that the annotated class is a service class, such as business basic logic, and call external APIs.
3. @Configuration It is used as a source of bean definitions. It is a class-level annotation.
4. @Controller The annotation is used to indicate that the class is a web request handler. It is often used to present web pages. It is most commonly used with @RequestMapping annotation. 
5. @RequestMapping RequestMapping is used to map the HTTP request. It is used with the class as well as the method. It has many other optional elements like consumes, name, method, request, path, etc
6. @Autowired This annotation is used to auto-wire spring bean on setter methods, constructor and instance variable. It injects object dependency implicitly. When we use this annotation, the spring container auto-wires the bean by its matching data type.
7. @Component It is a class-level annotation that turns the class into Spring bean at the auto-scan time.
8. @EnableAutoConfiguration It is placed on the main application class. Based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings, this annotation instructs SpringBoot to start adding beans.
9. @Required This annotation is applied to bean setter methods. It indicates that the required property must be filled at the configuration time in the affected bean, or else it throws an exception: BeanInitializationException.
10. @SpringBootApplication It consists of @Configuration, @ComponentScan, and @EnabeAutoConfiguration. The class annotated with @SpringBootApplication is kept in the base package. This annotation does the component scan. However, only the sub-packages are scanned.

### 2.explain how the below annotaitons specify the table in database?
1.it defines a column in table whose name is 'name', type is varchar(255) and default value is 'John Snow'
2.it defines a column in table whose name is "STUDENT NAME" and type is varchar(50). The column can not be null and not unique.

### 3.What is the default column names of the table in database for  @Column?
first_name
operating_system

### 4.What are the layers in springboot application? what is the role of each layer?
1. Presentation Layer
The presentation layer is the top layer of the spring boot architecture. It consists of Views. i.e., the front-end part of the application. It handles the HTTP requests and performs authentication. It is responsible for converting the JSON fieldâ€™s parameter to Java Objects and vice-versa. Once it performs the authentication of the request it passes it to the next layer. i.e., the business layer.
2. Business Layer
The business layer contains all the business logic. It consists of services classes. It is responsible for validation and authorization
3. Persistence Layer
   The persistence layer contains all the database storage logic. It is responsible for converting business objects to the database row and vice-versa.
4. Database Layer
   The database layer contains all the databases such as MySql, MongoDB, etc. This layer can contain multiple databases. It is responsible for performing the CRUD operations.

### 5.Describe the flow in all of the layers if an API is called by Postman
Step 1: Initializing a Spring Boot Project.
Step 2: Connecting Spring Boot to the Database.
Step 3: Creating a User Model.
Step 4: Creating Repository Classes.
Step 5: Creating a Controller.
Step 6: Compile, Build and Run.

### 6.What is the application.properties? do you know application.yml?
1.in a spring boot application, application. properties file is used to write the application-related property into that file. This file contains the different configuration which is required to run the application in a different environment, and each environment will have a different property defined by it.
2.YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files. So YAML configuration file in Spring Boot provides a very convenient syntax for storing logging configurations in a hierarchical format. The application. properties file is not that readable.
