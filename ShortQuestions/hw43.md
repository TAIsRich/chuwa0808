1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Springboot?
 * Spring is a lightweight and open-source application framework. It provides comprehensive infrastracture support for developing java applications. Two key priciples of springs are dependency injection and inversion of control. Spring has the ability to autowire dependencies at run time, which allows developers write loosely coupled code. 
 * Springboot is an open-source and microservice based java web framework. It is an extension of spring framework. It creates a fully production-ready environment that is completely configurable using its prebuilt code within its codebase. 
 * Springboot has a number of features that make it a great fit for quickly developing java applications, including auto-configuration, embedded servers, health checks, and opininated dependencies. 

3. What is IOC and What is DI?
 * Inversion of control is a principle which transfer the control of objects of a program to a container or framework to achieve loosely coupling between objects. The Spring Ioc container will make the objects, wire them together, configure them, and deal with them life circle from creation till destruction. 
 * Spring Dependency injection is a way to inject the dependency of a framework component by the following ways of spring: Constructor Injection and Setter Injection

4. What is @ComponentScan?
 * @ComponentScan annotation is used to specify packages to locate components in Spring. 

5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
 * <context:component-scan> detects the annotations by package scanning. It tells Spring which packages need to be scanned to look for the annotated beans or components. @Component, @Repository, @Service, @Controller, @RestController, and @Configuration are several ones that <context:component-scan> can detect.
```
 	   <context:component-scan base-package="com.chuwa.springbasic"/> 
```
 * Spring will look for annotated beans and dependencies under the package indicated by the base-package attribute. 
 * By annotation
```
   @Configuration
   @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.chuwa.springbasic"})
```

6. What is @SpringbootApplication?
 * It replaced three annotations @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan, and @Configuration since version 1.2. It enables Java configuration and lets you use Spring Beans in the class. It enables component scanning and means controller classes and components you create can be discovered by the framework. It also enables Spring Bootâ€™s autoconfiguration. 

7. How many ways we can define a bean?
 * There are three different ways to create a bean. 
   * Create bean inside a XML Configuration file (beans.xml)
```
      <bean id="AnyUniqueId" class="ClassName">
   	  </bean>
```
   * Using @Component annotation
     * @Component is an annotation that allows Spring to automatically detect the custom beans. 
   * Using @Bean annotation
     @Bean is applied on a method. It is usually declared in Configuration classes methods.
     ```
     @Configuration
     @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.chuwa.springbasic"})
     public class BeanConfig {

        @Bean
        public College collegeBean() {
            return new College();
        }
     }
     ```
     
8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
 * The default bean name is @Bean annotated method name.
 * @Componet is a class level annotation. The default bean name is that the class name converts first letter to lowercase.

9. What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
 * We can use @Component across the application to automatically scans and registers classes as Spring beans. 
 * @Service indicates that they're holding the business logic. 
 * @Repository and @Service are a specialization of @Component in persistence layer and service layer. @Repository not only helping in annotation based configuration but also catch Platform-specific exception and re-throw them as one of Spring's unified unchecked exception.

10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
  * @Autowired: match by type, by @Qualifier, by name
  * @Resource: match by name, by type and then by @Qualifier
  * @Inject: match by type, by @Qualifier, then by name

11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
  * Constructor based dependency injection:
  * Setter based dependency injection:
  * Field based dependency injection:
```
    @Autowired
    public Class(File file){
         this.file = file;
    }

    @Autowired
    public void setEmp(Employee employee){
         this.employee = employee;
    }

    @Autowired
    private Filter filter;
```

  * Constructor injection is better because it is useful to check if all the required dependency are loaded. The IoC container makes sure that all the arguments provided in the constructor are available before passing them into the constructor. This help preventing NullPointerException.

12. If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
  * When there are multiple beans available of same type in Spring container, all of them are qualified to be autowired to single-valued dependency. That causes ambiguity and leads to throw an exception by framework. @Primary indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified to autowire a single-valued dependency. There should be only one @Primary bean among same type of beans.
```
  @Bean
  @Primary
  public Animal kangarooBean() {
    return new Animal("Kangaroo");
  }
```
  * Using the @Qualifier annotation to clearly mark the intention to inject a specific bean from the context. 

13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
  * Bean Factory
    * Bean instantiation/wiring
  * Application Context
    * Bean instantiation/wiring
    * Automatic BeanPostProcessor registration
    * Automatic BeanFactoryPostProcessor registration
    * Convenient MessageSource access (for i18n)
    * ApplicationEvent publication

14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
    1. *singleton:* This scopes the bean definition to a single instance per Spring IoC container (default).
    @Bean
    @Scope("singleton")
	public Person personSingleton() {
	    return new Person();
	}
    2. *prototype:* This scopes a single bean definition to have any number of object instances. 
    @Bean
	@Scope("prototype")
	public Person personPrototype() {
	    return new Person();
	}
    3. *request:* This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP request. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
    @Bean
	@RequestScope
	public HelloMessageGenerator requestScopedBean() {
	    return new HelloMessageGenerator();
	}
    4. *session:* This scopes a bean definition to an HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
    @Bean
	@SessionScope
	public HelloMessageGenerator sessionScopedBean() {
	    return new HelloMessageGenerator();
	}
	@Bean
	@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_SESSION, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
	public HelloMessageGenerator sessionScopedBean() {
	    return new HelloMessageGenerator();
	}
    5. *global-session:* This scopes a bean definition to a global HTTP session. Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.
    * Singleton scoped beans initialize when container starts. Prototype scoped beans initialize when ask for it using the getBean method. 3. Prototype bean also gets initialize when it is used as a dependency inside a singleton scoped bean.

15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="foo" class="x.y.Foo">
        <meta key="cacheName" value="foo"/>
        <property name="name" value="Rick"/>
    </bean>

</beans>
```
