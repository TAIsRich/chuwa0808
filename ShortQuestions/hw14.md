1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
   1. 
2. What is HTTP Session?
   1. HTTP is stateless, session is used to store user info, session id and related user info will be stored at database, each time when user access server, he should bring sessionID inside the http request, so that server can know which user send this request, the default time of session is 30 mins.
3. What is Cookie?
   1. cookie is stored in client side that hold user info, usually sessionid or JWT token will be stored in it.
4. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
   1. cookie is stored in client-side, but session is stored in server side. session is safer but more time-consuming.
5. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the application?
   1. we can store session id into cookie, everytime when user send http request it will bring session id then server will fetch user information from database. different application will access same user database table, therefore user info can be shared across the app.
6. What is the spring security filter?
   1. spring security filter is usually WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, it has a request matcher that is used to decide whether to apply it to an HTTP request.
7. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
   1. BCryptPasswordEncoder
8. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行) 
   1. UserDetailService can provide function like loadUserByUserName to get user details, help retrieve username, password etc
   2. AuthenticationProvider provide functionality to generator authenticated object like token
   3. AuthenticationManager: If the principal of the input authentication is valid and verified, AuthenticationManager#authenticate returns an Authentication instance with the authenticated flag set to true. 
   4. AuthenticationFilter: A Filter that performs authentication of a particular request. it will check if request bring authentication token, if it exists, there is no need to authenticate again.
9.  What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
    1.  it may reduce performance, because session data stored in server.
    2.  using JWTToken
10. What is JWT?
    1.  json web token, server can build jwt token using user info and secrete provided in server, and jwt api can also decode token to get user info.
11. decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
    1.  when user sign in server without bringing token, if it is validated, server will generate token based on user info and secrete, then return to client side.
    2.  next time when this user send heep request with token in http header, the server will check if it is correct.
12. how to get value from application.properties?
    1.  @Value("${app.jwt-secret}")
13. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
    1.  configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth): used by the default implementation of authenticationManager() to attempt to obtain an AuthenticationManager. If overridden, the AuthenticationManagerBuilder should be used to specify the AuthenticationManager.
    2.  configure(HttpSecurity http): Override this method to configure the HttpSecurity. Typically subclasses should not invoke this method by calling super as it may override their configuration. The default configuration is: http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated().and().formLogin().and().httpBasic(); usually apply filter chain on requests.
14. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
    1.  authentication is just validate user's credential to check if it can access the system.
    2.  authorization is the mechanism to assign different roles with different range of authority. like user, admin, test, viewer etc
