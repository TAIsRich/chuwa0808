## HW14

### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
annotaitons.md

### 2. What is HTTP Session?
```
HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application

```

### 3. What is Cookie?
```
An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
```

### 4. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
```
Cookie	Session
Cookies are client-side files on a local computer that hold user information.	Sessions are server-side files that contain user data.
Cookies end on the lifetime set by the user.	When the user quits the browser or logs out of the programmed, the session is over.
It can only store a certain amount of info.	It can hold an indefinite quantity of data.
The browser’s cookies have a maximum capacity of 4 KB.	We can keep as much data as we like within a session, however there is a maximum memory restriction of 128 MB that a script may consume at one time.
Because cookies are kept on the local computer, we don’t need to run a function to start them.	To begin the session, we must use the session start() method.
Cookies are not secured.	Session are more secured compare than cookies.
Cookies stored data in text file.	Session save data in encrypted form.
Cookies stored on a limited data.	Session stored a unlimited data.
In PHP, to get the data from Cookies , $_COOKIES the global variable is used	In PHP  , to set the data from Session, $_SESSION the global variable is used
We can set an expiration date to delete the cookie’s data. It will automatically delete the data at that specific time. 	In PHP, to destroy or remove the data stored within a session, we can use the session_destroy() function, and to unset a specific variable, we can use the unset() function.

```

### 5. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
application?
```
With cookie-based session management, a message (cookie) containing user information is sent to the browser by the web server. 
This cookie is sent back to the server when the user tries to access certain pages. 
The cookie allows the server to identify the user and retrieve the user session from the session database, so that the user session is maintained. 
A cookie-based session ends when the user logs off or closes the browser. 

```

### 6. What is the spring security filter?
```
Spring Security executes most of its security features using the filter chain. Spring security is driven through servlet filters in web applications. A servlet filter intercepts requests before they reach the protected resource (e.g., a Spring controller). As a result, every request for a protected resource will be processed through a spring security filter chain for completing authentication and authorization purposes.
```

### 7. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
```
BCryptPasswordEncoder

```

### 8. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
AuthenticationFilter?(把这⼏个名字看熟悉也⾏)
```
UserDetailsService
default configuration provided by Spring security and further customizing it according to requirements.
It is used to retrieve user-related data. Its primary responsibility is to find a user by its username

AuthenticationProvider
Authentication providers are responsible to perform a specific authentication

AuthenticationManager
AuthenticationManager manages the authentication modules that an application uses. 
Authentication Manager delegates the request to the right Authentication Provider and returns the Authenticated Object to Authentication Filter

AuthenticationFilter
Authentication filters let you set an authentication scheme for individual controllers or actions
Authentication Filter creates an Authentication Request and Passes to Authentication Manager.

```

### 9. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
```
sessions make it more difficult to keep servers in balance. 
A server can become overloaded if it accumulates too many sessions, or if specific sticky sessions require a high number of resources. 
This could result in your load balancer having to shift a client to a different server mid-session, resulting in data loss.

using session cookies to overcome the disadvantages

```
### 10. What is JWT?
```
A JSON web token(JWT) is JSON Object which is used to securely transfer information over the web(between two parties). It can be used for an authentication system and can also be used for information exchange.The token is mainly composed of header, payload, signature. These three parts are separated by dots(.). JWT defines the structure of information we are sending from one party to the another, and it comes in two forms – Serialized, Deserialized. The Serialized approach is mainly used to transfer the data through the network with each request and response. While the deserialized approach is used to read and write data to the web token.
```
### 11. decribe how do JWT work(slides ⾥有图，†26页)
```
Client post username and password
Server validate/authenticate the username and password, and then generate the JWT
Server then return the generated JWT to the client
Client is able to use this JWT to act any permiteed actions with JWT in the header
Server receive the action request, validate the JWt, and then return the response

 
```

### 12. how to get value from application.properties?
```
use @Value annotation

@Value ("${value_from_application_properties}")
private string name
```

### 13. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
```
configure(HttpSecurity http) enables users to easily configure Spring Security / handle security exceptions by setting authorization 
configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)  enable the authentication based on our database information

```

### 14. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
```
•	Authentication: This refers to the process of verifying the identity of the user, using the credentials provided when accessing certain restricted resources. Two steps are involved in authenticating a user, namely identification and verification. An example is logging into a website with a username and a password. This is like answering the question Who are you?  
•	Authorization: It is the ability to determine a user's authority to perform an action or to view data, assuming they have successfully logged in. This ensures that users can only access the parts of a resource that they are authorized to access. It could be thought of as an answer to the question Can a user do/read this?
