2. What is HTTP Session?
 * HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.

 * A typical HTTP session: In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:
   1. The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).
   2. The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.
   3. The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.

 * As of HTTP/1.1, the connection is no longer closed after completing the third phase, and the client is now granted a further request: this means the second and third phases can now be performed any number of times.

3. What is Cookie?
 * Cookies are text files with small pieces of data—like a username and password—that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience. 

 * Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection. This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer. When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network server, the server reads the ID and knows what information to specifically serve to you.

4. What is the difference between Session and Cookie?
 **Definition**
 * Cookies are client-side files that are stored on a local computer and contain user information.
 * Sessions are server-side files that store user information.
 **Expiry**
 * Cookies expire after the user specified lifetime.
 * The session ends when the user closes the browser or logs out of the program.
 **Data storage**
 * It can only store a limited amount of data.
 * It is able to store an unlimited amount of information.
 **Capacity**
 * Cookies can only store up to a maximum of 4 KB of data in a browser.
 * There is a maximum memory restriction of 128 megabytes that a script may consume at one time. However, we are free to maintain as much data as we like within a session.
 **Function**
 * It is not necessary for us to execute a function in order to get cookies going because they are stored on the local computer.
 * Utilizing the session start()method is required before we can begin the session.
 **Data Format**
 * Cookies are used to store information in a text file. 
 * The data is saved in an encrypted format during sessions.
 **Safety**
 * Cookies are considered to be less safe than sessions since a third-party can manipulate the data that is stored in them.
 * sessions are stored in an encrypted form that the user alone can read.

5. How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the application?
 * The client request to the server via GET or POST method. The sessionID is created on the server, and it saves the sessionID into the database. It returns the sessionId with a cookie as a response to the client. Cookie with sessionID stored on the browser is sent back to the server. The server matches this id with the saved sessionID and sends a response HTTP200

6. What is the spring security filter?
 * In a web application, we drive Spring security through the servlet filters. Servlet filters works by intercepting the request before it reaches to the actual resource (e.g. Spring controller). This is how filters work in a web application: 

 1. Client sends the request for a resource (MVC controller). Application container create filter chain to process incoming request.
 2. Each HttpServletRequest pass through the filter chain based on the path of the request URI. (We can configure if we execute filter chain for all request or for specific request URI).
 3. Filters can change the HttpServletRequest or HttpServletResponse before it reached to our Spring MVC controller. Can stop the processing of the request and send a response to the client. (e.g. Servlet not allowing requests to specific URI’s).

 * The Spring Security filter contains a list of filter chains and dispatches a request to the first chain that matches it. 

7. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
 * Spring Security provides password encoding feature using the **PasswordEncoder** interface. The standard use of this feature is to compare the user-provided password at the time of authentication (encoding the user password).

 * Spring Security 5.0 introduces **DelegatingPasswordEncoder** as the new encoder to address following issues: Encode password using latest storage recommendations. Allowing for upgrading the encoding.

 * The **BCryptPasswordEncoder** implementation uses the bcrypt algorithm to hash the passwords.
 * `$2a$10$96AvWDbaCiJlfzZ1fwZej.GSXFkAmPjqj12uSMa/RyB6zsIvsgNy.`
   1. The first part represents the version ($2a, $2b, $2y) – in our case it is $2a$.
   2. The second part is the strength – $10$ for our example.
   3. The next 22 characters are the salt for the password (96AvWDbaCiJlfzZ1fwZej.).
   4. Remaining section is the hashed password.

8. What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager? 
AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
 * The **UserDetailsService** interface is used to retrieve user-related data. It has one method named loadUserByUsername() which can be overridden to customize the process of finding the user. It is used by the DaoAuthenticationProvider to load details about the user during authentication.

 * Authentication providers are responsible to perform a specific authentication. Spring security provides several AuthenticationProvider . AuthenticationProviders can't execute directly, but spring security uses ProviderManager class which delegates to a list of configured authentication providers.

 * AuthenticationManager is the main strategy interface for authentication. If the principal of the input authentication is valid and verified, AuthenticationManager#authenticate returns an Authentication instance with the authenticated flag set to true.

 * AuthenticationFilter is a filter that performs authentication of a particular request. An outline of the logic: A request comes in and if it does not match setRequestMatcher(RequestMatcher), then this filter does nothing and the FilterChain is continued.

9. What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
 * 1. Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory. 2. Overhead involved in serializing and De-Serializing session data because in case of StateServer and SQLServer session mode we need to serialize the object before store. 3. Storing too much data in the Session could cause scalability issues.

10. What is JWT?
  * JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

11. Describe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
  * A common way to use JWTs is as OAuth bearer tokens. An authorization server creates a JWT at the request of a client and signs it so that it cannot be altered by any other party. The client will then send this JWT with its request to a REST API. The REST API will verify that the JWT’s signature matches its payload and header to determine that the JWT is valid. When the REST API has verified the JWT, it can use the claims to either grant or deny the client’s request.

12. How to get value from application.properties?
  * A simple way to read application properties is to use @Value annotation. Simply annotation the class field with @Value annotation providing the name of the property you want to read from application.properties file and class field variable will be assigned that value.

  @Value("${app.title}")
  private String appTitle;

13. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
 * configure(HttpSecurity) allows configuration of web based security at a resource level, based on a selection match - e.g. The example below restricts the URLs that start with /admin/ to users that have ADMIN role, and declares that any other URLs need to be successfully authenticated.
```
 protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
        .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
}
```
 * configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder) is used to establish an authentication mechanism by allowing AuthenticationProviders to be added easily: e.g. The following defines the in-memory authentication with the in-built 'user' and 'admin' logins.
```
 public void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) {
    auth
        .inMemoryAuthentication()
        .withUser("user")
        .password("password")
        .roles("USER")
    .and()
        .withUser("admin")
        .password("password")
        .roles("ADMIN","USER");
 }
```

14. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
  * Authentication and authorization are two vital information security processes that administrators use to protect systems and information. Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights.
