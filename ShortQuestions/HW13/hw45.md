1.  List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
    annotaitons.md

2.  What is HTTP Session?
    * HTTP sessions is an industry standard feature that allows Web servers to maintain user identity and to store user-specific data during multiple request/response interactions between a client application and a Web application.
3.  What is Cookie?
    * HTTP cookies are essential to the modern Internet but a vulnerability to your privacy. As a necessary part of web browsing, HTTP cookies help web developers give you more personal, convenient website visits. Cookies let websites remember you, your website logins, shopping carts and more.
4.  What is the difference between Session and Cookie?

5.  How do we use session and cookie to keep user information across the the
    application?
    * After the user logs in successfully, save the user name to the cookie and session, and set the effective time of the cookie at the same time. When the user wants to log in without entering password, directly determine whether the user name in the cookie is consistent with the session. If so don't need to enter, otherwise need to re-enter username and password.
6.  What is the spring security filter?
    * Spring Security maintains a filter chain internally where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required. The ordering of the filters is important as there are dependencies between them.
7. Do you use any Encoder to encode Password?
8.  What is UserDetailService? AuthenticationProvider?AuthenticationManager?
    AuthenticationFilter?(把这几个名字看熟悉也行)
    * The UserDetailsService interface is used to retrieve user-related data. It has one method named loadUserByUsername() which can be overridden to customize the process of finding the user. It is used by the DaoAuthenticationProvider to load details about the user during authentication.
    * Spring Security provides a variety of options for performing authentication. These options follow a simple contract; an Authentication request is processed by an AuthenticationProvider, and a fully authenticated object with full credentials is returned.
    * The AuthenticationManager is the main strategy interface for authentication. If the principal of the input authentication is valid and verified, AuthenticationManager#authenticate returns an Authentication instance with the authenticated flag set to true.
    * Class AuthenticationFilter is a Filter that performs authentication of a particular request. An outline of the logic: A request comes in and if it does not match setRequestMatcher(RequestMatcher) , then this filter does nothing and the FilterChain is continued.
9.  What is the disadvantage of Session? how to overcome the disadvantage?
    * Performance overhead in case of large number of user, because of session data stored in server memory. 
    * Overhead involved in serializing and De-Serializing session data because in case of StateServer and SQLServer session mode we need to serialize the object before store.
10. What is JWT?
    * JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.
11. decribe how do JWT work(slides 里有图， 26页)
    ```
    JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. 
    What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, 
    or what permissions the client has been granted.

    A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, 
    compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.
    
    Once decoded, you will get two JSON strings:
    1. The header and the payload.
    2. The signature.
    
    The JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) header contains the type of token — JWT in this case — and the signing algorithm.
    
    The payload contains the claims. This is displayed as a JSON string, usually containing no more than a dozen fields to keep the JWT compact. 
    This information is typically used by the server to verify that the user has permission to perform the action they are requesting.
    
    There are no mandatory claims for a JWT, but overlaying standards may make claims mandatory. 
    For example, when using JWT as bearer access token under OAuth2.0, iss, sub, aud, and exp must be present. some are more common than others.
    
    The signature ensures that the token hasn’t been altered. The party that creates the JWT signs the header and payload with a secret that is known to both the issuer and receiver, 
    or with a private key known only to the sender. When the token is used, the receiving party verifies that the header and payload match the signature.
    ```
12. how to get value from application.properties?
    * You can use the @Value annotation and access the property in whichever Spring bean you're using
    ```java
        @Value("${userBucket.path}")
        private String userBucketPath;
    ```
13. What is the role of configure(HttpSecurity http) and
    configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)?
    * The configure(final HttpSecurity http) method overrides the default HttpBuilder configuration. Because it's empty, it leaves the application without authorization or authentication
    * To configure the authentication, we have to override the configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) method of the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class.To perform the authentication of a user, we need an Authentication Manager which we can implement using the AuthenticationManagerBuilder object. This method helps us to provide the object of AuthenticationManagerBuilder using the method parameter. In this builder object, we configure the security information for user authentication.
14. What is Spring security authentication and authorization?
