2. What is hibernate Caching?
    Hibernate caching acts as a layer between the actual database and your application. It reduces the time taken to obtain the required data — as it fetches from memory instead of directly hitting the database. 

3. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
    First Level Cache: 
    This is local to the Session object and cannot be shared between multiple sessions.
    This cache is enabled by default and there is no way to disable it.
    The first level cache is available only until the session is open, once the session is closed, the first level cache is destroyed.

    Second Level Cache:
    This cache is maintained at the SessionFactory level and shared among all sessions in Hibernate.
    This is disabled by default, but we can enable it through configuration.
    The second-level cache is available through the application’s life cycle, it is only destroyed and recreated when an application is restarted.
