# 2 What is hibernate Caching?
Two level cache: 1st level cache in session level and 2nd level cache in sessionFactory
 
# 3 What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
First level cache: 
- In session level, do not need to fetch data in the database, but return the target from session level directly.
- cannot be shared between multiple sessions
- The cache is enabled by default and there is no way to disable it
- available only until the session is open, if the session is closed, the first level cache is destroyed

If the target didn't find in the first level, then go to the second level cache:
- can be shared among al sessions in the hibernate
- available throught the application's life cycle. 
- destroyed and recreated when an application is restarted.

If target didn't find int the second level, then the required data will be fetched and loaded from the database.

# 4 @Transactional

We can get a transaction with below:

transaction = session.beginTransaction();

- If any step failed, the whole process will be rolled back to the 1st step, and the process failed.
- The process is success only if all the requred steps processed successfully.
