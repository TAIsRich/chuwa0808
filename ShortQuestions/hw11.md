1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
2. What is hibernate Caching?
   1. hibernate caching is helping reduce calling database which improve performance a lot because accessing database is I/O operation which is time-consuming.
3. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
   1. hibernate have 2 layers of caching, 1st is session level, it is located inside the session, if 1st cache hit it will return instead of searching in database and 2nd cache, 1st cache is defaultly set to true.
   2. the 2nd is disabled by default, it's cross-session, managed by sessionFactory, if 1st cache miss, the snd cache will search other sessions, and if it hits it will return and save in 1st cache, if it not hit it will search database.
   3. so the order is 1st cache -> 2nd cache -> database.
4. How do you understand @Transactional?
   1. “Spring provides Declarative Transaction Management via @Transactional annotation. When a method is applied with @Transactional, then it will execute inside a database transaction. @Transactional annotation can be applied at the class level also, in that case, all methods of that class will be executed inside a database transaction.”
5. How do you handle the exception in Spring?
   1. Globally, I will use @ControllerAdvice to check expection at the application level
   2. specifically, I will write a exception class extending RunTimeException class etc to handle some specific situation. this may be used with try catch togather.
6. How do you do the validations in Spring?
   1. I will use @Valid annotation at request body, and define some rules on the payload object like @notnull etc.
