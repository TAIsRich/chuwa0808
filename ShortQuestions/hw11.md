### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
annotaitons.md

### 2. What is hibernate Caching?

```
Hibernate caching is the strategy for improving the application performance by pooling objects in the cache so that the queries are executed faster. Hibernate caching is particularly useful when fetching the same data that is executed multiple times. Rather than hitting the database, we can just access the data from the cache. This results in reduced throughput time of the application.

Types of Hibernate Caching
First Level Cache:
•	This level is enabled by default.
•	The first level cache resides in the hibernate session object.
•	Since it belongs to the session object, the scope of the data stored here will not be available to the entire application as an application can make use of multiple session objects.
Second Level Cache:
•	Second level cache resides in the SessionFactory object and due to this, the data is accessible by the entire application.
•	This is not available by default. It has to be enabled explicitly.
•	EH (Easy Hibernate) Cache, Swarm Cache, OS Cache, JBoss Cache are some example cache providers.
```

### 3. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?

```
Hibernate has 2 cache types. First level and second level cache for which the difference is given below:
First Level Cache	Second Level Cache
This is local to the Session object and cannot be shared between multiple sessions.	This cache is maintained at the SessionFactory level and shared among all sessions in Hibernate.
This cache is enabled by default and there is no way to disable it.	This is disabled by default, but we can enable it through configuration.
The first level cache is available only until the session is open, once the session is closed, the first level cache is destroyed.	The second-level cache is available through the application’s life cycle, it is only destroyed and recreated when an application is restarted.
If an entity or object is loaded by calling the get() method then Hibernate first checked the first level cache, if it doesn’t find the object then it goes to the second level cache if configured. If the object is not found then it finally goes to the database and returns the object, if there is no corresponding row in the table then it returns null.

```

### 4. How do you understand @Transactional?

```
Describes a transaction attribute on an individual method or on a class.
@Transactional annotation is used when you want the certain method/class(=all methods inside) to be executed in a transaction.
The @Transactional annotation is metadata that specifies that an interface, class, or method must have transactional semantics; for example, "start a brand new read-only transaction when this method is invoked, suspending any existing transaction".

```

### 5. How do you handle the exception in Spring?

```
•	Steps
a.	create ErrorDetails Class
b.	Create GlobalExceptionHandler Class
c.	Test using Postman Client

```

### 6. How do you do the validations in Spring?

```
•	Steps
o	Import dependecy
o	add validation rule to payload
o	Add @valid to controller to apply the rule
o	Check it in postman
```
