1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
2. type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD, name the new branch with 05_slides_JPQL_EntityManager_Session.
   1. 
3. What is JPQL?
   1. JPQL is similar like SQL, but it is used at entity and we can  use entitymanager to manage it.
4. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
   1. @NamedQueries defines many @namedQuery and @nameQuery define a single named query.
5. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
   1. @Query defines a single sql or JPQL query
   2. @Query in repository interface. interface that should extend repository.
6. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
   1. HQL is hibernate query lanuage, and usually using session to execute hql.
   2. A query criterion is an expression that Access compares to query field values to determine whether to include the record that contains each value.
7. What is EnityManager?
   1. entitymanager is interface to operate entity, like merge, find() etc. Also, it can execute namequery using jpql to operate entity.
8. What is SessionFactory and Session?
   1. Session is in hibernate, it provides interface from application to data stored in database.
   2. sessionfactory can create session. and it will be used during the second caching in hibernate.
9.  What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
    1.  a transaction represent a unit of work, if one step fails all will fail and roll back, only all steps succeed, it will succeed.
    2.  @transaction can be used in class or method, which mean the whole class or method is transactional. @EnableTransactionManagement should be added on spring boot main file.
10. Write a simple factory design pattern.
   ```
   public interface CarFactory{
      Car createCar();
   }

   public abstract class Car{
      public abstract String getMsg();
   }

   public class Benz extends Car{
      @Override
      public String geMsg(){
         return "I'm Benz";
      }
   }
   public class Audi extends Car{
      @Override
      public String geMsg(){
         return "I'm Audi";
      }
   }

   public class BenzFactory implements CarFactory{
      @Override
      public Car createCar(){
         Benz b = new Benz();
         return b;
      }
   }

   public class AudiFactory implements CarFactory{
      @Override
      public Car createCar(){
         Audi a = new Audi();
         return a;
      }
   }
   ```
