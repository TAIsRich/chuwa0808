JPQL – jpa query

- 操作entity, 不是table，类似于sql的一套语法，作用在entity层，写在最开始
- dao层里面要自己写怎么跟数据库联系

# 4
namedQuery – 应用在entity层的，调用某一个具体的变量

namedQueries –可以包含很多namedQuery

# 5
如果我们用了@Query则方法名就可以违背JPA naming convention

# 6
HQL:

Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties.

Criteria Queries:

It enables us to write queries without doing raw SQL as well as gives us some object-oriented control over the queries, which is one of the main features of Hibernate. The Criteria API allows us to build up a criteria query object programmatically, where we can apply different kinds of filtration rules and logical conditions.

# 7
The EntityManager API is used to create and remove persistent entity instances, to find entities by their primary key, and to query over entities.

- manages connection to a database as well as to database operations.
- associate with a PersistenContext
- interface to the Persistence Context 
- All operations on the entity go through the EntityManager 
- usually decalred in the class and mark with @PersistenceContext
- provides a number of methods that perform SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries

# 8 
SessionFactory:

It is a heavyweight object which usually is created during application start-up for connecting to a database and kept for later use. It also services clients to obtain Session instances from this factory.

Session:

This is the central API class abstracting the notion of a persistence service, the main function of the Session is to offer to create, read and delete operations for instances of mapped entity classes.

Represent a unit of work.

If one step fails, the whole transaction fails.
