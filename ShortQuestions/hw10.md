## HW 10
### 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to
annotaitons.md

### 2. type the code, you need to checkout new branch from branch 02_post_RUD,
name the new branch with 05_slides_JPQL_EntityManager_Session.

### 3. What is JPQL?
```
JPQL is Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification. It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database. JPQL is developed based on SQL syntax. But it won’t affect the database directly.
JPQL can retrieve information or data using SELECT clause, can do bulk updates using UPDATE clause and DELETE clause. EntityManager.createQuery() API will support for querying language.
```

### 4. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
```
@NameQueries annotation is used to define the multiple named queries.
@NameQuery annotation is used to define the single named query.
```

### 5. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
```
The @Query annotation declares finder queries directly on repository methods. While similar @NamedQuery is used on domain classes, Spring Data JPA @Query annotation is used on Repository interface. This frees the domain classes from persistence specific information, which is a good thing.

```







### 6. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?

```
•	HQL is to perform both select and non-select operations on the data,  but Criteria is only for selecting the data, we cannot perform non-select operations using criteria
•	HQL is suitable for executing Static Queries, where as Criteria is suitable for executing Dynamic Queries
•	HQL doesn’t support pagination concept, but we can achieve pagination with Criteria
•	Criteria used to take more time to execute then HQL
•	With Criteria we are safe with SQL Injection because of its dynamic query generation but in HQL as your queries are either fixed or parametrized, there is no safe from SQL Injection.
Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties. HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries, which in turns perform action on database.

Criteria Queries: to build up a criteria query object programmatically where you can apply filtration rules and logical conditions.

```


### 7. What is EnityManager?
```
A JPA EntityManager manages connection to a database as well as to database
operations. EntityManager is associated with a PersistenceContext. All operations that
are performed in a specific session are stored inside the PersistenceContext.
EntityManager is the interface to the Persistence Context. All operations on the
entity go through the EntityManager. We will declare an EntityManager object in our
class and mark it with the @PersistenceContext annotation.

must use @Transactional since the operation should be atomic
EntityManager provides a number of methods that perform SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
and DELETE queries.
```

### 8. What is SessionFactory and Session?
```
SessionFactory is a factory class for Session objects. It is available for the whole application while a Session is only available for particular transaction. Session is short-lived while SessionFactory objects are long-lived. SessionFactory provides a second level cache and Session provides a first level cache.

The session object provides an interface between the application and data stored in the
database.
```

### 9. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
```
A transaction simply represents a unit of work.
In such case, if one step fails, the whole transaction fails (which is termed as atomicity). A transaction can be described by ACID properties
```

### 10. Write a simple factory design pattern.
```
public interface Shape {
   void draw();
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {

   @Override
   public void draw() {
      System.out.println("Inside Rectangle::draw() method.");
   }
}

public class Square implements Shape {

   @Override
   public void draw() {
      System.out.println("Inside Square::draw() method.");
   }
}

public class Circle implements Shape {

   @Override
   public void draw() {
      System.out.println("Inside Circle::draw() method.");
   }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
	
   //use getShape method to get object of type shape 
   public Shape getShape(String shapeType){
      if(shapeType == null){
         return null;
      }		
      if(shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")){
         return new Circle();
         
      } else if(shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")){
         return new Rectangle();
         
      } else if(shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")){
         return new Square();
      }
      
      return null;
   }
}

```
