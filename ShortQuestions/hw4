# 6. Optional is a container object used to contain not-null objects. Optional object is used to represent null with absent value. This class has various utility methods to facilitate code to handle values as ‘available’ or ‘not available’ instead of checking null values.


# 7. Functional Interface – an annotation for interface
Has only one abstract method
Has a lot default methods
Will have a sanity check
Lambda is the implementation of the abstract method

# 8. Lambda
Replace anonymous inner class
Work with functional interface
内部可以调用的object – final修饰 || 从来没有改变过值的object || object地址没变

# 9. Method Reference

Method references are a special type of lambda expressions. They're often used to create simple lambda expressions by referencing existing methods.

There are four kinds of method references:
Static methods
Instance methods of particular objects
Instance methods of an arbitrary object of a particular type
Constructor


# 10. Java 8 new features that we need to know:
Functional Interfaces.
Lambda expressions.


# 11. Yes. The object didn’t change.
