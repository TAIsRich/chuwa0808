### 2. What is MVC pattern?
- MVC pattern is used for modern web applications because it allows the application to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to expand. It helps programmer break up the frontend and backend code into separate components, which means it's much easier to manage and make changes to either side without them interfering with each other. It can be divided into three components to explain the concept of MVC.


- Controller: The controller's responsibility is to pull, modify, and provide data to the user. Essentially, the controller is the link between the view and model.  The function of the controller is to handle a user request. The incoming request may be handled in different ways like reading form data, processing it in some way, storing data in a database, or retrieving data from a web service etc. The controller places the data in the model which, simply put, is a container for the data. The controller returns the model (containing data) back to the front controller

- Model : The model's job is to simply manage the data. Whether the data is from a database, API, or a JSON object, the model is responsible for managing it. Controller populates the model with data from a form or a database or a web service. As can be seen from the Spring MVC request flow diagram, the controller passes the model to the front controller which forwards it to the view resolver. The view template displays the data in the model.

- View: View template receives the model containing data. It reads the model and displays the data. If, say, the model contains a list of players, the view template can create a table to display that list. In most cases a view template is a JSP page that provides data to the user
### 3. What is Front-Controller?
- DispatcherServlet
- It is used to provide a centralized request handling mechanism so that all requests will be handled by a single handler. This handler can do the authentication/ authorization/ logging or tracking of request and then pass the requests to corresponding handlers
### 4. What is DispatcherServlet? please describe how it works.
- When the web server receives the HTTP Request, it will give the Request to DispatcherServlet to handle.
- Then, it will call HandlerMapper with the Request
- The HandlerMapper will send the Request to the specific controller which can handle it
- The controller will return the view name and Model, the view name back to Handler Adapter, and eventually back to DispatcherServlet.
- The DispatcherServlet will use the view name to call view Resolver
- View Resolver helps programs find out view templates like list-customers.jsp
- Once the program has both the Model and view template, it can call the View engine to store the data into the view template, then transform it into pure HTML
- This HTML is what the front-end should present and how it returns to the browser.
### 5. What is JSP and What is ModelAndView？(please google to have basic knowledge)
- Jakarta Server Pages (formerly JavaServer Pages) is a Java standard technology that developers use to write dynamic, data-driven web pages for Java web applications. JSP is built on top of the Java Servlet (aka Jakarta Servlet) specification and is one of the Java web technologies included for ongoing support and upgrades in Jakarta EE.
- ModelAndView is a holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. These two classes are distinct; ModelAndView merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value.
### 6. Could you please google any other servlets(理解多少是多少，不要花太多时间，知道servlet的名字就⾏。)
- Servlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. They are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce the response, then send a response back to the webserver.
### 7. How many web server do you know? (Tomcat, Jetty, Jboss)
- JBoss, Microsoft IIS, NGINX, Jetty, and Flask
