### 3. What is JPQL?
```
JPQL is Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification. 
It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database. 
JPQL is developed based on SQL syntax. But it wonâ€™t affect the database directly.
```

### 4. What is @NamedQuery and @NamedQueries?
```
@NameQueries annotation is used to define the multiple named queries. 
@NameQuery annotation is used to define the single named query.

@NamedQueries({
    @NamedQuery(name="Country.findAll",
                query="SELECT c FROM Country c"),
    @NamedQuery(name="Country.findByName",
                query="SELECT c FROM Country c WHERE c.name = :name"),
}) 
```

### 5. What is @Query? In which Interface we write the sql or JPQL?
```
A Query is similar in syntax to SQL, and it's generally used to perform CRUD operations. The @Query annotation takes precedence over named queries.

By default, the query definition uses JPQL.
```

### 6. What is HQL and Criteria Queries?
```
Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties.
The criteria query API lets us build nested, structured query expressions in Java, providing a compile-time syntax checking that is not possible with a query language like HQL or SQL. 

- HQL is to perform both select and non-select operations on the data,  but Criteria is only for selecting the data
- HQL is suitable for executing Static Queries, where as Criteria is suitable for executing Dynamic Queries
```

### 7. What is EnityManager?
```
The EntityManager is an API that manages the lifecycle of entity instances. 
An EntityManager object manages a set of entities that are defined by a persistence unit. 
Each EntityManager instance is associated with a persistence context.
```

### 8. What is SessionFactory and Session?
```
SessionFactory is a factory class for Session objects. 
It is available for the whole application while a Session is only available for particular transaction. 
```

### 9. What is Transaction? how to manage your transaction?
```
A transaction is a logical unit of work that contains one or more SQL statements. 
A transaction is an atomic unit -  if one step fails, the whole transaction fails (which is termed as atomicity). 

Transaction management refers to the tasks of processing multiple transactions issued by various clients of a database server in such a way that the ACID contract can be fulfilled
Transaction management is generally understood as requiring serializability-based concurrency control as well as recovery from failures. 
Concurrency control is the task of scheduling transactions such that their serializability can be guaranteed, 
while recovery has to restore a consistent database state after a system or media failure. 
```
