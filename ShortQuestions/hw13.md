# 2. What is MVC pattern?

model - view -controller

The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consist of a data model, presentation information, and control information. The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects.

MVC is more of an architectural pattern, but not for complete application. MVC mostly relates to the UI / interaction layer of an application. 

1. Model: contains data, no logic describe of how to present the data.
2. View: present the data to user, know how to access the model's data, but don't konw how to manipulate data.
3. Controller: fetch the requst and execute appropriate reaction to the event. 

# 3. What is Front-Controller?

Controller contains the logic part of the application. When a requested is posted, the controller will fetch the request and decide which part of the logic layer (which method) should be executed to acquire the response data to the fetched request.

Handles all the HTTP requests and response.
