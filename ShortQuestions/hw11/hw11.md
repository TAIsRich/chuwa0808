### 2. What is hibernate Caching?
```
Hibernate caching is the strategy for improving the application performance by pooling objects in the cache so that the queries are executed faster. 
Hibernate caching is particularly useful when fetching the same data that is executed multiple times. 
Rather than hitting the database, we can just access the data from the cache. This results in reduced throughput time of the application.
```

### 3. What is the difference between first-level cache and second-level cache?
```
First Level Cache:
- This level is enabled by default.
- The first level cache resides in the hibernate session object.
- Since it belongs to the session object, the scope of the data stored here will not be available to the entire application as an application can make use of multiple session objects.

Second Level Cache:
- Second level cache resides in the SessionFactory object and due to this, the data is accessible by the entire application.
- This is not available by default. It has to be enabled explicitly.
```

### 4. How do you understand @Transactional?
```
It is used to combine more than one writes on a database as a single atomic operation. 
When the method annotated with @Transactional is called, all OR none of the writes on the database is executed.
```

### 5. How do you handle the exception in Spring?
```
@ExceptionHandler
- Method Level
- used to handle the specific exceptions and sending the custom responses to the client

@ControllerAdvice
- Class Level
- to handle the exceptions globally

Steps  
1.  create ErrorDetails Class
2.  Create GlobalExceptionHandler Class
3.  Test using Postman Client
```

### 6. How do you do the validations in Spring?
```
1. import dependency
2. add validation rule to payload
  - @NotEmpty
  - @Size(min = ?, message = "error message")
3. add @valid to controller to apply the rule here
  - public ResponseEntity<PostDto> createPost(@Valid @RequestBody PostDto postDto){}
4. check it in Postman
```
