1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotaitons.md
2. What is Spring and Springboot? What is the benfits of using Srpingboot?
   1. Spring framework provides support for developing java application, features of Spring include dependency injection. there are also spring mvc, spring security and spring aop etc.
   2. Springboot is an extension of spring which eliminates the configuration of spring.
3. What is IOC and What is DI?
   1. IOC is inversion of control, IOC container include beans and impl object like component, service, repository and controller etc.
   2. DI is dependency injection. when there is scenario which need impl object, the ioc container will inject a bean to variable, usually using @Autowire.
4. What is @ComponentScan?
   1. ComponentScan will scan all the beans under the basePackages path, and put it in ioc container. it will scan beans like @Service, @Component, @Service, @Bean, @Repository and @Controller etc.
5. How to define which package spring need to scan in xml and annotaiton?
   1. xml: <context:component-scan base-package="com.xx.xxxx"/>
   2. annotation: @ComponentScan(basePackages = {"com.xx.xxxx"})
6. What is @SpringbootApplication?
   1. It's same as declaring a class with @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan annotations.
7. How many ways wo can define a bean?
   1. 3 types: 1, @Service, @Repository, @Component, @Controller. 2, @Bean on method. 3, xml file definition.
8. What is default bean name for @Component and @Bean?
   1. According to the CDI specification, the default name for a managed bean is the unqualified class name of the bean class, after converting the first character to lower case. For example, if the bean class is named ProductList, the default bean name is productList.
9.  What is the difference between @component and @service,@repository?
    1.  @service,@repository are also @Component
10. How many annotaitons we can use to inject the bean?
    1.  @Autowire, @Resource and @Inject
11. Tell me the three types to do dependency injection(How can we inject the beans
in Spring)? Which way is better and why?
   constructor injection, setter injection and field injection
   constructor injection is better, we can be 100% sure that the class will never be changed  with dependencies injected. so that preventing NullPointerExceptions and other errors. Cyclic dependency is also not possible with Constructor based injection.
1.  If we have multiple beans for one type, how to set one is primary? and how to let
the spring to pick one bean to inject if no primay.
   we can use @Primary to set primary, we can use @Qualifier to assign specific impl class.
13. What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext in Spring?
    1. BeanFactory is the most basic version of IOC containers which should be preferred when memory consumption is critical whereas ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory, so you get all the benefits of BeanFactory plus some advanced features for enterprise applications
    2. BeanFactory only supports 2 bean scopes, singleton and prototype whereas ApplicationContext supports all bean scopes
    3. Annotation based dependency injection is not supported by BeanFactory whereas ApplicationContext supports it
    4. BeanFactory instantiates beans on-demand i.e. when the method getBean(beanName) is called, it is also called Lazy initializer whereas ApplicationContext instantiates beans at the time of creating the container where bean scope is Singleton, so it is an Eager initializer
14. What is the Scope of a Bean? and list the examples for each scope.
    1.  singleton will produce just one bean for each container, some tool classes or stateless classes like service, reposiroty and controller etc will be singleton.
    2.  prototype will produce bean each time when it be called. some object classes that will be changed should use prototype 
    3.  request, session, global 
15. Configure a bean using xml. If bean has parameters/dependencies, how can we
configure the bean? (you can google the tutorial how to configure beans in xml, and feel free to ask me any quesitons if you don't understand. it is a little bit old, I am not sure if I need to exaplain it in class)
